I wanted to create this section because we still go to restaurants/stores. So I wanted to list restaurants that have somewhat acceptable foods, despite the bad ingredients; or legit food. However, I will score each item.
‚ÄºÔ∏è All Items will start at 10 points by default. ‚ÄºÔ∏è 

The scoring that I will take into consideration is as follows: 

All natural Ingredients: +10 Points

1 to 3 Bad ingredients:  +1 Points

*Note: Items might have a different score based on the quantity. For example, if a food item have a bad score, eat less of it. Doing the math with a smaller amount makes the score go up. The more you eat, the more 
unhealthy is it.
