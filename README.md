# HealthProgram
I created this to track the health of foods, mainly from restaurants.


I wanted to create this section because some still go to restaurants. So I wanted to list restaurants that have somewhat acceptable foods, despite the bad ingredients. However, I will score each dish.
‚ÄºÔ∏è All Dishes will start at 10 points by default. ‚ÄºÔ∏è 

The scoring that I will take into consideration is as follows: 

All natural Ingredients: +10 Points

1 to 3 Bad ingredients:  +3 Points

4 to 5 Bad ingredients: -3 Points

6 or more Bad ingredients: -5 Points

Any Organic Ingredients: +3 Points

----

850 or More Calories Total: -2 Points
